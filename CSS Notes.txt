That's one way to add style to an element, but a better way is by using CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets.  
At the top of your code, create a style element like this:  
<style>  
</style>  
Inside that style element, you can create a CSS selector for all h2 elements. For example, if you wanted all h2 elements to be red, your style element would look like this:  
<style>  
  h2 {color: red;}  
</style>  
Note that it's important to have both opening and closing curly braces ({ and }) around each element's style. You also need to make sure your element's style is between the opening and closing style tags. Finally, be sure to add the semicolon to the end of each of your element's styles.  
Classes are reusable styles that can be added to HTML elements.  
Here's an example CSS class declaration:  
<style>  
  .blue-text {  
    color: blue;  
  }  
</style>  
You can see that we've created a CSS class called blue-text within the <style> tag.  
You can apply a class to an HTML element like this:  
<h2 class="blue-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>  
Note that in your CSS style element, classes should start with a period. In your HTML elements' class declarations, classes shouldn't start with a period.  
Remember that you can attach classes to HTML elements by using class="your-class-here" within the relevant element's opening tag. 
Font size is controlled by the font-size CSS property, like this: 
h1 { 
  font-size: 30px; 
} 
You can set an element's font by using the font-family property. 
For example, if you wanted to set your h2 element's font to Sans-serif, you would use the following CSS: 
h2 { 
  font-family: Sans-serif; 
} 
 
CSS borders have properties like style, color and width 
For example, if we wanted to create a red, 5 pixel border around an HTML element, we could use this class: 
<style> 
  .thin-red-border { 
    border-color: red; 
    border-width: 5px; 
    border-style: solid; 
  } 
</style> 
 
Hyper-link reference and anchor 
a elements, also known as anchor elements, are used to link to content outside of the current page. 
Replace the value of your a element's href attribute with a #, also known as a hash symbol, to turn it into a dead link. 
 
 
Padding & margin 
You may have already noticed this, but all HTML elements are essentially little rectangles. 
Three important properties control the space that surrounds each HTML element: padding, margin, and border. 
An element's padding controls the amount of space between the element and its border. 
An element's margin controls the amount of space between an element's border and surrounding elements. 
An element's margin controls the amount of space between an element's border and surrounding elements. 
If you set an element's margin to a negative value, the element will grow larger. 
Sometimes you will want to customize an element so that it has different padding on each of its sides. 
CSS allows you to control the padding of an element on all four sides with padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, and padding-left properties. This works for margin as well. 
Instead of specifying an element's padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, and padding-left properties, you can specify them all in one line, like this: 
padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; 
These four values work like a clock: top, right, bottom, left, and will produce the exact same result as using the side-specific padding instructions. 
 
Override 
!important 
body style  
Class 
ID 
In-line style 
Order of priority for overriding style use !important after an element to override everything making it top priority. 
------------------------
Different color way:
(beside using the color name)

COLOR 
hex 
#000000 - #FFFFFF 
The first two is pure red #FF0000 
Second two is pure green #00FF00 
Third two is pure blue #0000FF 
 
You can shorten the color by using only 3 digit 
1 digit per color #F00 is red 
 
RGB 
Another way you can represent colors in CSS is by using RGB values. 
The RGB value for black looks like this: 
rgb(0, 0, 0) 
The RGB value for white looks like this: 
rgb(255, 255, 255)

rbga
rgba is like rgb (reb, green, blue) the a is for alpha that allow you to do transparentcy

hsl
(hue, saturation, lightness) Hue is a degree on the color wheel (from 0 to 360) - 0 (or 360) is red, 120 is green, 240 is blue. Saturation is a percentage value; 0% means a shade of gray and 100% is the full color.

hsla
(hue, saturation, lightness alpha) Hue is a degree on the color wheel (from 0 to 360) - 0 (or 360) is red, 120 is green, 240 is blue. Saturation is a percentage value; 0% means a shade of gray and 100% is the full color. The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (fully opaque).
